 sunrise_over_the_country_desc:0 "Surprisingly, it appears that certain leaders within the far-right leagues were less organized than even the police force, with some of them not even participating in the coup attempt.

 please_follow_us_monsieur_maurras_desc:0 "Charles Maurras, the leader of the Action Française, a royalist organization who aims to restore French monarchy may not be the biggest opponent to us, but it is surely the most violent one.
