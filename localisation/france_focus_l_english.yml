 state_of_french_politics_desc:0 "French politics are currently in a state of turmoil. The recent "transition" of the Paris Police Prefect, Jean Chiappe, has plunged the political landscape into chaos. In the streets of Paris, left-wing and right-wing extremists are engaged in violent confrontations. Urgent action is imperative to safeguard the French government, as the consequences of inaction are uncertain and potentially dire."
