"Cold Blood : France" is an ongoing development Hearts of Iron IV mod who aims to envision a world where the antiparlementarism riots of the February, 6th of 1934 followed with the collapse of the Third French Republic.

## Development of the story : 
*Envision a world where France's government crumbled during the tumultuous events of February 6th, 1934. 
Those somber days marked the demise of the Third Republic, with the Head of Government, Paul Doumer, discovered lifeless within the National Assembly. 
The "Ligues" celebrated, convinced that these perceived traitors were vanquished for good. 
France was slipping into the grasp of fascists and Nazi sympathizers, or a communist revolt could overthrow everything. 
In this alternate reality, the course of a weakened France's destiny rests in your hands. You can choose to adopt a radical anti-democratic stance, navigate France through these dark times and keep the light of democracy, restore the monarchy with the Action Française, or implement political reforms you find the best in the land of the "Déclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen."*
